# Logical Verification 2025

Files associated with the Hitchhiker's Guide to Logical Verification (2025
edition).


## Installation

The Hitchhiker's Guide PDF document is generated from the Lean demo files in
the folder `lean/LoVe`. The same folder also contains exercise sheets and
homework sheets.

To edit the Lean files, open the `lean` folder as a Lean 4 project [as described
here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html#working-on-an-existing-project).
